This project uses React to create an app to allow users to book interviews. Users are able to view available time slots, interviewers, and days available to book interviews. Once booked, a user may edit and/or cancel an interview. Testing using Storybook, Jest, and Cypress were leveraged to verify the functionality of this app.
